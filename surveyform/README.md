FCC survey form - end of unit test

the basis for this test was to recreate a survey webpage funcionally the same as the prepared webpage found 
here:https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/

in order to pass the test, a number of requirements had to be met as per the instructions.

it took me three attempts from scratch to get it to meet the parameters given, and for the final attempt 
i used chrome dev tools to get a better idea of how the page was laid out (using divs for instance, as opposed to 
fieldsets as in my original attempts) and i also copy pasted the css for the image in the body, and to get the
opacity settings the same in the form and body. apart from that, almost all of the rest of page was written out 
from scratch. 

I have learned a few things along the way, such as a better understanding of selectors, and a better understanding
of block/inline properties. ive also gained a little experiance in debugging my code, as in order to meet some
of the requirments, i had to go through my code and make some minor corrections.
