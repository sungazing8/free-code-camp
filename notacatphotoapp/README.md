# free-code-camp

while working through the odin project, ive hit a snag on the rock paper scissors assignment. ive realised i need a better understanding of javascript in order to move forward. ive decided to go back to basics to speak, and go through some other sources in order to do so. im starting with free code camp, to see how this alternative approach improves my knowledge base.
