FCC rothko painting exercise 

this exercise from FCC is a quick one designed to teach a few new techniques using CSS. the exercise gets the student to recreate a rothko style painting in a frame.

the exercise covers basics of how to use margin, padding and border to manipulate elements.

new CSS elements i encountered in this lesson:

filter: blur(2px)
border radius, margin, and box shadow shorthand
transform: rotate(1deg); - clockwise (-1deg) - counter clockwise
