FCC flex photo gallery exercise

an introduction into flex box with some flex properties. a photo gallery organised using flex.

new properties i learned from this exercise: (im already somewhat familier with flex from previous courses)

object-fit: cover: this property crops photos to fit new ratios

::after{
    content""
};             

this property allows you to change alignment of the last child element of a parent.
